                        <li class="s3">Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge,<br>
                            and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules,<br>
                            behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s<br>
                            what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel<br>
                            valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to<br>
                            succeed.</li>
                        <li class="s4">In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that<br>
                            *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments,<br>
                            and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to<br>
                            change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of<br>
                            design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</li>

                        <li class="s3">Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a<br>
                            combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the<br>
                            filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools<br>
                            and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information,<br>
                            foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told<br>
                            story.</li>
                        <li class="s4">With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on<br>
                            the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in<br>
                            film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why<br>
                            they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</li>

                            is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration<br>
